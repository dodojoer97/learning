Certainly! Here are some exercises to deepen your understanding and practice the Factory Design Pattern in TypeScript:

1. **Basic Shapes Factory**:

   - Define an interface `Shape` with a method `draw()`.
   - Create concrete classes `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` implementing the `Shape` interface.
   - Create an abstract class (or interface) `ShapeFactory` with a method `createShape()`.
   - Implement concrete factories for each shape.
   - In the client code, use these factories to create and draw different shapes.

2. **Database Connection Factory**:

   - Define an interface `DatabaseConnection` with methods `connect()` and `disconnect()`.
   - Implement concrete classes for `MySQLConnection`, `PostgreSQLConnection`, and `MongoDBConnection`.
   - Create an abstract class (or interface) `DatabaseFactory` with a method `createConnection()`.
   - Implement concrete factories for each database connection type.
   - Use these factories to establish connections to different databases in the client code.

3. **Theme Elements Factory**:

   - Suppose you are building a UI library, and you have themes like "Dark" and "Light".
   - Define an interface `Button` with a method `render()`.
   - Create concrete implementations like `DarkButton` and `LightButton`.
   - Use the Factory Pattern to produce buttons based on the theme selected by the user.

4. **Payment Gateway Factory**:

   - Define an interface `PaymentGateway` with methods `authorize()`, `debit()`, and `credit()`.
   - Implement concrete classes like `PayPal`, `Stripe`, and `CreditCard`.
   - Create a Factory that returns the appropriate payment gateway based on user preference or country restriction.

5. **Animals in a Zoo**:
   - Define an `Animal` interface with methods `speak()` and `type()`.
   - Create concrete classes like `Lion`, `Parrot`, and `Snake`.
   - Create a Factory to produce different animals based on a string input (e.g., "lion", "parrot").

For each exercise:

- Aim to design your code in such a way that adding a new concrete type (e.g., a new shape, database connection, theme element, etc.) does not require you to modify existing factory logic.
- Once you've implemented the Factory Pattern, test your implementation by adding a new concrete type to ensure your design adheres to the open-closed principle.

- Additionally, try refactoring your solution using the Simple Factory pattern, which uses a single class to handle the creation logic based on some condition. Compare the pros and cons of each approach.
