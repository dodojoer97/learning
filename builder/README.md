Certainly! Practicing with exercises is a great way to grasp the Builder pattern. Here are a few exercises:

### Exercise 1: User Account Builder

Create a `User` class where each user has a `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `phoneNumber`, and `address`. Not all information is required to create a user, but at least a `firstName` and `email` are mandatory.

### Exercise 2: Pizza Builder

Create a `Pizza` class where a pizza can have various toppings, a choice between `regular`, `thin`, or `stuffed` crust, and a choice of `small`, `medium`, or `large` size. Create a builder class to help with creating pizza objects.

### Exercise 3: HTML Element Builder

Design a simple HTML builder using the builder pattern. Create classes for different HTML elements like `DivElement`, `SpanElement`, etc. and ensure they can be nested within each other to form a hierarchy. Each element class should have a method to set attributes, set content, and nest other elements. The builder class should have methods to construct these objects and assemble them into a complete HTML structure.

### Exercise 4: Query Builder

Create a SQL query builder using the builder pattern to construct SELECT queries. The builder should support selecting individual columns, specifying a FROM clause, adding WHERE clauses, and limiting the number of rows returned.

### Exercise 5: Computer Configuration Builder

Create a `Computer` class that requires various configurations like `CPU`, `RAM`, `Storage`, `GraphicsCard`, `PowerSupply`, etc. Use the Builder pattern to help create Computer objects with various configurations.

For each exercise, follow these steps:

1. Identify the complex object(s) you are going to build.
2. Create a Builder class for each complex object. Implement methods for setting each part of the object.
3. Implement a `build()` method in each Builder class to return the completed object.
4. Test your Builders with client code to ensure they function as expected.

These exercises will help you practice and understand the Builder pattern in depth, and how it can be used to create complex objects in a readable and maintainable manner.
