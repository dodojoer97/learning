Certainly! Letâ€™s create some exercises based on a scenario to understand and apply the S.O.L.I.D principles better.

Suppose you are working on a simplified e-commerce system. Below are exercises related to each principle:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - Create a `Product` class that holds information like `name`, `price`, and `description`.
   - Create a separate `ProductDB` class responsible for saving and loading `Product` instances to/from a database.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - Create an `Order` class that holds a list of products.
   - Now extend the system to support different types of discounts without modifying the `Order` class. For instance, create classes for a flat discount, percentage discount, and no discount.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - Assume there's a `Membership` class representing a customer's membership in your e-commerce platform. This membership determines the discount rate the customer receives.
   - Now, create two subclasses: `PremiumMembership` and `BasicMembership`. Ensure that they can replace `Membership` without altering the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - Create interfaces like `InventoryManagement`, `CustomerManagement`, and `OrderManagement` each with methods related to their respective concerns.
   - Implement these interfaces in classes where appropriate, making sure no class implements an interface with methods it doesn't need.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - Assume your system needs to notify customers when their order status changes. Create an abstract `Notifier` interface and then create implementations like `EmailNotifier`, `SmsNotifier`.
   - Ensure that high-level classes depend on the `Notifier` abstraction and not on concrete implementations.

You can try implementing these exercises using TypeScript. They will help you understand and apply the S.O.L.I.D principles in a real-world-like scenario.
